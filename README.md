# Binary-Integer-Programming-CPLEX

This project is all about optimizing the allocation of delivery agents,delivery vehicles and hubs in an e-commerce supply chain to minimize the total cost associated .

*****************The project contains the following files :

* An .R file that simulates the data based on the distribution of different parameters that are associated in the whole process
* An .dat file which is a component of a CPLEX Project that contains the data simulated by using R 
* An .mod file which is also a component of CPLEX Project that contains the optimization model with constraints, decision variables and the parameters.
